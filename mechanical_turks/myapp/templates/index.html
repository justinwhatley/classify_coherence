    <h1>Text Incoherence</h1>
    <p>
		The purpose of this study is to assess text-incoherence in automatically generated text.
        We define text-incoherence as text which does not follow logically. Put another way, incoherent
        texts should not make clear sense. For example, "I'm hungry because it is snowing" should be
        labelled incoherent.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each question in the form will include two texts and you are tasked with selecting
		the most <i>incoherent</i> text from the pair. In a follow-up question, you will be asked
        to indicate your confidence in your selection of the incoherent sentence, indicating how
        incoherent the selected text is relative to the non-selected sentence.
