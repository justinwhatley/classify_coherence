# Classify Coherence
An attempt to classify sentences from the Penn Discourse Treebank as either coherent or incoherent. 

### Getting Started
To get started,  you will need acces to the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) (the CLaC lab has the data). 
Once you have this, add a PDTB `relations-XX-XX-XX-{dev | train | test}.json` file to the `/data` directory, and update the value of `relations_json` in `generate_sentences.py` (declared around line 10) to the name of that file. 

In order to train with the Google News word2vec embeddings, you will need to download them (available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM), and unzip them in the `\model` directory. 

### Functionality breakdown

Below are brief explanations of what each python file does, and how it interacts with other files.

#### generate_sentences.py 
This script takes a PDTB `.json` file from the `/data` directory and create the coherent and incoherent datasets for our model from it. It first reads the `.json` and extracts relevant values from it, then it creates the various datasets (specifying which one  in the comments) in `.json` format.

#### preprocess.py 
This file takes the resulting `.json` files from `generate_sentences.py` and converts them to `.txt`. It also calculates corpus-wide statistics, such as the number of terms, the dictionary, the maximum sentence length, etc. 

#### train.py 
This file is where we run our convolutional neural network. It defines many flags for the various hyperparameters, then loads the data from specified file and transforms it to the format needed by the network. It then implements the training loop for the network, and saves intermediate results, while printing relevant information to the screen.

#### cnn.py 
This is the class that implements the underlying logic of our convolutional neural network. It creates the actual network, connects layers, implements the convolution, etc. 

#### sampling.py 
Prepares samples for either Mechanical Turks or Crowdflower(deprecated) in order to validate sentence corruption techniques

#### mechanical_turks
Web server logic which can be used to process results from a Mechanical Turks output csv file or an output csv file generated from a local server which simulates the Mechanical Turks testing environment

#### connective_middle_frequency.py 
This file looks at which connectives in our data are more likely to be in the middle of `Arg1` and `Arg2`. It was not used for our experiments, but is still in the code because it would be useful if we want to experiment with unannotated data in the future. 

### Folder structure breakdown

`/`
Main folder, contains the python files, as well as README and the vocabulary

`/crowdflower_data`
Data uploaded to Crowdflower for manual annotations

`/data`
Where we store the various datasets used in the project. The files in this folder directly are the PDTB files, along with data about the corpus (`corpus_stats.txt`, `dictionary.txt`)

  `/data/json`
      `.json` files generated by `generate_sentences.py`

  `/data/model`
      word2vec Google News model (3GB in size, available for download at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM)

  `/data/random`
      Randomized datasets with different values of `gamma`, output of `randomize_words.py`

  `/data/rt-polaritydata`
      Rotten Tomatoes reviews, used to evaluate our model 

  `/data/txt`
      Input data for `train.py` constructed from the PDTB data

`/runs`
Model parameters saved by tensorflow after each run
